# A user has $40,000 in savings, she would like a maximum monthly mortgage payment around (a) $3,000 per month, (b) would prefer a home with around 2,000 squarefeet and (c) would like to buy homes that give her as much down % possible (e.g. a home with 20% down is optimal compared to 5%). Given the CSV (attached) of homes for sale, can you output homes sorted closest to the userâ€™s preferences in descending order? The output can be of any format you choose (CSV, JSON, HTML, etc.). You can write this recommender in any of: Ruby, Python, Javascript or Java.
